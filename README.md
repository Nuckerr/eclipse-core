# EclipseChat
##Features:
* Tab list
* Chat with hover components
##How to use:
Everything in the config file goes through MiniMessage and through placeholder api. This will allow you to use full RGB in any 
feature of this plugin. See the documentation of MiniMessage here: <https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage>
##Permissions:
* `eclipsechat.about` Allows you to perform `/eclipsechat about`. Just shows the version number.
* `eclipsechat.reload` Allows you to perform `/eclipsechat reload`. Reloads from config.
* `eclipsechat.markdown` Allows you to use basic markdown in chat, such as *italic* **bold** and others.
* `eclipsechat.fullminimessage` Allows you to use everything in minimessage in chat. This should only be given to people you 
  trust, as you can add hover components and links to your messages.
